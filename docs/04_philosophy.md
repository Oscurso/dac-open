# Philosophy Behind DAC

## The Problem with Probabilistic AI
Modern AI systems are statistical guessers.  
They can generate impressive results — but they cannot **explain themselves**.

DAC emerges as a response to this epistemic opacity.  
It prioritizes *reasoning over randomness* and *determinism over probability*.

## The Cognitive Transparency Ethic
Every DAC reasoning chain is a story: a series of explicit decisions,  
each justified and logged. No hidden parameters, no stochastic shortcuts.

This transforms AI from a black box into a **glass mind** —  
visible, inspectable, and accountable.

## Determinism ≠ Rigidity
Being deterministic does not mean static.  
DAC systems can evolve, adapt, and learn — but always within explicit, reproducible boundaries.

---

## The Future of DAC
As DAC matures, it will redefine:
- How cognitive software is audited
- How AI systems explain themselves
- How humans trust machine cognition
