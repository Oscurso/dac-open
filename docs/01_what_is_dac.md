# What is Deterministic Artificial Cognition (DAC)

## Abstract
Traditional AI systems rely on probabilistic models that produce outputs without transparent reasoning.
**Deterministic Artificial Cognition (DAC)** introduces a new paradigm where **every cognitive process
is explainable, reproducible, and observable**.

---

## The Core Principle

DAC treats cognition as a **structured reasoning tree**, not as a black-box output.
Each step — from perception to conclusion — is logged in a machine-readable format (e.g. `reasoning.json`).

The result is a transparent cognitive framework that allows humans and machines
to **understand why** a decision was made.

## Why It Matters

- **Accountability:** Every action can be traced.
- **Reliability:** Deterministic systems always produce the same result for the same input.
- **Safety:** No hidden probabilistic bias or unpredictable randomness.
- **Interoperability:** Reasoning chains can be analyzed, shared, and improved collaboratively.

## DAC in One Sentence

> **DAC is explainable cognition — not a black box, but a transparent mind.**
